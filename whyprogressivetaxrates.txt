The flat tax is considered by many as the fairest system of taxation. But it is only fairest if fair is defined to be everyone paying the same percentage of their income. It is just as reasonable to argue that the fairest system would be for everyone to pay a flat fee. That can certainly be defined as fair. Or maybe everyone pays the same percentage of their total wealth. That can also be defined to be fair. Maybe everyone pays something equivalent to some market value of the government services rendered. If Bill Gates would be willing to pay $1 billion to protect his property and an unemployed mother would only pay $50 then Mr. Gates should pay significantly more. Without a strong government, the wealthy would be forced to pay exorbinant amounts to protect their wealth. Everyone pays 50% of the market value could also be fair.

Everyone wants the tax code to be fair, but if their are so many way to define fairness then the government (via the people) must decide the best notion of fairness. My argument is that everyone should feel approximately same amount of sacrifice when paying taxes. If a single mother pays her taxes knowing that the bill means she cannot properly clothe her family then Bill Gates should feel at least a little discomfort when the tax bill comes due. The decreasing marginal utilty of money requires that taxation be progressive.

Taxation must be fair so taxing abstract ideas like wealth can favor the dishonest too much. Thus, income and property are the way to go. Tax rates on Americans struggling to make it to the next paycheck must be significantly reduced if there is any hope of making them fair.

The estate tax is not a mechanism for transferring wealth from rich to poor. The estate tax removes an incentive to wait until death to transfer wealth to your children. Without an estate tax the best way to transfer money without being taxed is to wait until death. Thus people hoard their riches until they pass away, and this hoarding is the least effective means of transfer. Elderly wealthy people do not take the risks, have the knowledge, or spend the time to determine the optimal investments for their capital. They are susceptible to fraud. And even the best planned wills can be contentious when dealing with tens of millions of dollars and dozens of heirs. 

Why should we encourage this less than optimal behavior?

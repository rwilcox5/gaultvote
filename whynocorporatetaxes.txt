Corporate taxes are great politics. Taxing a faceless corporation is better than a person with a family. But they also complicate taxation and that gives individuals with corporations an advantage. Corporations can move much more easily and go anywhere. Corporations can transfer money amongst themselves. Ultimately, those individuals that spend the most time and money on tax avoidance have an advantage. That perturbs the market and reduces efficiency. More infighting is never a good thing.

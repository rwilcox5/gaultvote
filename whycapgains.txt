Capital gains are taxed at a maximum rate of 20% which is about half the tax burden on other forms of income for high-income individuals. The capital gains rate is lower because it stimulates investment. And the capital gains rate is lower to eliminate double taxation.

A lower capital gains rate stimulates investment in capital that is subject to the lower rate. The government is forced to choose what forms of capital should be stimulated. The free market should be determining where capital flows not the government. 

Capital gains are not double taxed because the corporate tax rate is built into the price of the stock.

A higher capital gains rate means that losses receive a higher tax deduction. Thus risky investments maintain their valued status.

A progressive tax on capital gains will reward the middle class investors. Smart money will very slowly catch up to dumb money if the tax rates are equivalent.
